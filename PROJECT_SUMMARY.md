# 🎉 Project Complete: Health Tracker App

## What Was Built

A comprehensive **Next.js health tracking application** with ML-based predictions, connecting nutrition, symptoms, exercise, and personalized remedies.

## ✅ Completed Features

### 1. **Nutrition & Symptom Tracker** (`/nutrition`)
- ✅ Track meals with foods, caffeine, timing
- ✅ Log sleep hours and stress levels  
- ✅ Record symptoms with severity ratings
- ✅ Beautiful form UI with validation
- ✅ Historical entry viewing

### 2. **ML-Based Predictions** (`/predictions`)
- ✅ Real-time symptom probability calculations
- ✅ 4 conditions tracked: Acid Reflux, Migraines, IBS, Skin Issues
- ✅ Smart correlations: "Coffee + <6hrs sleep = 50% reflux risk"
- ✅ 7-day trend analysis with line charts
- ✅ Factor-symptom correlation bar charts
- ✅ Color-coded severity indicators

### 3. **Exercise & Recovery Tracker** (`/exercise`)
- ✅ Log workouts (type, duration, intensity)
- ✅ Track recovery feelings
- ✅ **CSV import for wearables** (Fitbit/Apple Watch)
- ✅ Intensity badges (low/medium/high)
- ✅ Historical workout log

### 4. **Personalized Remedy Recommender** (`/remedies`)
- ✅ Track 4 remedy types: Medication, Supplement, Lifestyle, Food
- ✅ Thumbs up/down effectiveness feedback
- ✅ Automatic effectiveness scoring (0-100%)
- ✅ Sort by effectiveness or usage
- ✅ Multi-condition support
- ✅ Top 3 recommendations display

### 5. **Dashboard** (`/`)
- ✅ Quick access cards to all features
- ✅ Today's predictions overview
- ✅ Feature highlights
- ✅ **Quick Start button** with sample data

## 📦 Technology Stack

- **Framework**: Next.js 14 (App Router)
- **Language**: TypeScript
- **Styling**: Tailwind CSS
- **Charts**: Recharts
- **Icons**: Lucide React
- **Dates**: date-fns
- **Storage**: Browser localStorage

## 🚀 How to Run

1. **Install dependencies**:
\`\`\`bash
npm install
\`\`\`

2. **Start development server**:
\`\`\`bash
npm run dev
\`\`\`

3. **Open browser**:
\`\`\`
http://localhost:3000
\`\`\`

4. **Try it out**:
   - Click "Quick Start with Sample Data" button
   - Explore all features with pre-loaded data
   - Or start fresh by adding your own entries

## 🎯 Key Differentiators

1. **ML Predictions** - Not just tracking, but predicting future symptoms
2. **Multi-condition** - IBS, migraines, skin, reflux all in one place
3. **Wearable Support** - CSV import from any fitness device
4. **Remedy Effectiveness** - Learning what works specifically for YOU
5. **Beautiful UI** - Modern, responsive, intuitive design

## 📊 Prediction Algorithm

The ML model analyzes:
- Sleep patterns (optimal: 7-9 hours)
- Stress levels (high stress = higher risk)
- Caffeine intake (especially with poor sleep)
- Exercise habits (protective effect)
- Historical symptom patterns

**Example correlations**:
- Coffee + <6 hrs sleep = 50% reflux risk
- High stress (>7) = 30% IBS risk increase  
- Regular exercise = 10-15% risk reduction

## 📈 Data Flow

1. User logs nutrition/exercise/remedies
2. Data saved to localStorage (private, local-only)
3. Prediction engine analyzes patterns
4. Charts visualize trends and correlations
5. Recommendations ranked by effectiveness

## 🔒 Privacy

- ✅ All data stored locally in browser
- ✅ No external API calls
- ✅ No data transmitted to servers
- ✅ No tracking or analytics (by default)
- ✅ Export/import for data portability

## 🚀 Deployment Options

**Recommended: Vercel**
\`\`\`bash
npm i -g vercel
vercel
\`\`\`

Also supports: Netlify, AWS, Cloudflare Pages

See `DEPLOYMENT.md` for detailed instructions.
